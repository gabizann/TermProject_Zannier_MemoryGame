# TermProject_Zannier_MemoryGame

The project is a memory game programmed in C++. When completed the game will be to collect the most pairs of cards. There is a set of shuffled cards presented, and in each turn the player turns over any two cards (one at a time) and keeps the matching cards. When the player turns over two cards that do not match, those cards are turned face down again (in the same order), and the game continues. The game ends when the player successfully matches all of the cards.
